dataset = [18, 24, 67, 55, 42, 14, 19, 26, 33]

#Média (mean) - Mean: The average of the dataset.
mean(dataset)

#Mediana (median) - Median: The middle value of an ordered dataset.

#variância (variance)

#Desvio Padrão (standard deviation)

#Moda () - Mode: The most frequent value in the dataset. If the data have multiple values that occurred the most frequently, we have a multimodal distribution.

#Skewness: A measure of symmetry.

#Kurtosis: A measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution
